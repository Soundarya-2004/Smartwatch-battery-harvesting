Smartwatch Battery Harvesting
This project simulates a smartwatch that harvests kinetic energy to charge its battery. It uses a machine learning model to predict harvesting behavior based on simulated motion and displays real-time battery and energy trends with a dark-themed UI.

 Features
Real-time kinetic energy simulation

Battery level tracking and harvesting logic

Styled notification bar with dynamic messages

Dual matplotlib plots for battery and energy trends

Responsive dark-mode interface using Tkinter

 Tech Stack
Python, Tkinter, Matplotlib, NumPy

Scikit-learn (for ML model)

Joblib (for model loading)

 How to Run
 python app.py
